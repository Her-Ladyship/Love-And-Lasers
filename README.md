# 💘 Love & Lasers 💥
*A 2D NES Space-Romance Shooter — developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (via Mesen)*

---

## 🛸 About the Game

**Love & Lasers** is a hybrid shoot-em-up and dating sim where you play as the commander of a star cruiser in a war-torn galaxy full of danger... and potential soulmates.

Navigate intense side-scrolling space battles, then unwind with flirty post-mission chats with your eccentric alien crew. Who will win the war — and your heart?

Developed in C/Assembly for the NES as part of a university project, emulated through Mesen.
