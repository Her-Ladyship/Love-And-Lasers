Love & Lasers A 2D NES Space-Romance Shooter
________________________________________
Overview
Love & Lasers is a hybrid 2D shoot-em-up (shmup) and dating sim developed for the NES. The player takes on the role of a spaceship captain in the middle of an intergalactic war, balancing the tactical pressure of battle missions with the emotional high stakes of crewmate relationships. Gameplay alternates between space combat and short, dialogue-driven scenes where players can pursue romantic arcs with their quirky alien crew.
